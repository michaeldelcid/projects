#CPE 551 - NBA Stats

##NBA Stats - Python Final Project

- This repo will contain the code for my CPE 551 - Engineering Programming Python final project. This python 
script uses [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) to scrap team statistics from the [2019-20 NBA season](https://stats.nba.com/teams/traditional/)

- The team data I will be looking at will be:
	- Games played
	- Wins
	- Losses
	- Win percentage
	- Minutes
	- Points
	- Field goals made
	- Field goals attepted
	- Field goal percentage

- Please refer to NBAstats.csv to view all team data
